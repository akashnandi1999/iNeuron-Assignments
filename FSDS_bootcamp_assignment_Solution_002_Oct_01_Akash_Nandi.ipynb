    "1. What is indentation error? Why indentation is important? Give one simple example?\n",
    "Ans- When the spaces or the Tabs are not placed properly in the correct position, we get an Indentation Error.\n",
    "     Indentation is important as it gives a clear Readability of the code.\n",
    "     Below is the example of an Indentation:-\n",
    "     \n",
    "     course = 'ML'\n",
    "     if course == 'ML':\n",
    "         print('Start the Course') \n",
    "     else: \n",
    "         print('Please Register to start the course') \n",
    "     print('Best of Luck') \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Correct the following code and write the comment where you made the correction?\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "class_started = bool(input(\"Hey friend, is class started?: [0-False/1-True]\"))       # Made correction by removing the spaces from the beginning\n",
    "\n",
    "if class_started:                    # Made correction by removing the spaces from the beginning\n",
    "    print(\"Since class started...\")  # Made correction by removing the spaces and made the print statement within the \"if\" condition\n",
    "    print(\"Lets concentrate\")        # Made correction by removing the spaces and made the print statement within the \"if\" condition\n",
    "else:                                # Made correction by removing the spaces from the beginning\n",
    "    print(\"Since class is not started...\")  # Made correction by removing the spaces and made the print statement within the \"else\" condition\n",
    "    print(\"let's revise\")                   # Made correction by removing the spaces and made the print statement within the \"else\" condition\n",

    "a = 2\n",
    "b = 3\n",
    "c = 4\n",
    "\n",
